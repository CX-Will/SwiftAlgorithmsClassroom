### 4. SequenceType Extension

Instead of only sorting arrays, modify your function to sort any type conforming to `SequenceType`. So make your function to be an extension of `SequenceType` so that we can use it as `[1, 3, 2].selectionSort(<)` and `[1: "b", 2: "a"].selectionSort {$0.0 > $1.0}`.
*/

extension SequenceType {
    
}

//assert([1, 3, 2].selectionSort(<).isSorted())
//assert([1: "b", 2: "a"].selectionSort({$0.0 > $1.0}).isSorted({$0.0 > $1.0}))
